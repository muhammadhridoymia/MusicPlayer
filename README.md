 I built a Music Player app in Kotlin!

Over the past few days, Iâ€™ve been working on an Android app where users can play, pause, and navigate through songs directly from a clean Kotlin-based interface.

Current features:
Basic music playback (play/pause/next/previous)
Simple and clean UI
Built fully with Kotlin
